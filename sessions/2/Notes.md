# Session 2 Notes

Session 2 was mostly working out the low pass filter part of a hybrid image.

- I ended up going with a gaussian blur (Filter=30, Pre-Shrink=1) to function as the low pass filter
- Composited the blurred image with the previous high pass component
- Added some other composite stages
- I need to re-do the high pass filter
