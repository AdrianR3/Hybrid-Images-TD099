# Session 4 Notes

After a lot of trial and error, I got a result pretty close to the original target image.

My output is `my_output.png`, it sort of works as a hybrid image. As always, relevant project progress can be seen in `progress.png`

Next Up: Find out why the image filtering is no good, potentially do more Fourier transform exploration.
