# Session 1 Notes

I'm aiming to create the high frequency part of `output_target.png`. Try standing close to `output_target.png` and then about 10 feet away from it. You should see two different people at two different distances.

- Learned to use basic GLSL, followed a tutorial to create a high pass filter
- Created a GLSL Shader (glsl1_pixel.frag)
- Used another sharpening algorithm in touch designer to create another high pass image filter.
